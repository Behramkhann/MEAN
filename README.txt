This is an example MEAN stack APP.

HOW TO RUN THESE APPS.

First you have to run npm install in the main directories of both the workspaces i-e Angular-app and nodeApi.

NOTE: Both the Angular app and node api are in Development mode.

For serving the applications locally run "npm start" in the node-api main directory first and then run 
"ng serve" or "npm start" in the main directory of angular-app.

The app can be listened on "localhost:4200"
